# Sea-Turtle-Identification-Segmentation-by-unet
This project develops and compares three deep learning models (U-Net, ResFCN, and ResUNet) for automated sea turtle image segmentation, specifically targeting the head, flippers, and carapace regions. Using the comprehensive SeaTurtleID2022 dataset containing 8,729 photographs of 438 unique sea turtles collected over 13 years, the researchers evaluated model performance using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice coefficient metrics. ResUNet achieved the best performance with an average IoU of 0.7634, outperforming both U-Net and ResFCN due to its effective combination of residual learning and multi-scale feature fusion capabilities that enable precise boundary detection in complex backgrounds. The study aims to automate the traditionally labor-intensive manual segmentation process in wildlife studies, providing a more scalable and efficient computer vision solution for sea turtle identification and monitoring in conservation efforts.
