# Deep Learning Approaches for Sea Turtle Identification: Segmentation of Head, Flippers, and Carapace

## Overview

This project develops and compares three deep learning models (U-Net, ResFCN, and ResUNet) for automated sea turtle image segmentation, specifically targeting the head, flippers, and carapace regions. The research aims to automate the traditionally labor-intensive manual segmentation process in wildlife studies, providing a more scalable and efficient computer vision solution for sea turtle identification and monitoring.

## Dataset

**SeaTurtleID2022 Dataset** (Available on Kaggle)
- 8,729 photographs of 438 unique sea turtles
- Collected over 13 years across 1,221 encounters
- Rich annotations including identities, encounter timestamps, and detailed segmentation masks
- Longest-spanning collection for animal reidentification

## Models Implemented

### 1. U-Net
- **Architecture**: Encoder-decoder structure with skip connections
- **Strengths**: Preserves spatial detail, effective for pixel-level precision
- **Best for**: Tasks requiring fine-grained boundary detection

### 2. ResFCN (Residual Fully Convolutional Network)
- **Architecture**: Incorporates residual blocks and dilated convolutions
- **Strengths**: Multi-scale feature extraction, expanded receptive field
- **Best for**: Handling objects with varying scales and textures

### 3. ResUNet
- **Architecture**: Combines U-Net's encoder-decoder with ResNet's residual learning
- **Strengths**: Multi-scale feature fusion, attention-enhanced skip connections
- **Best for**: Complex scenes requiring both global context and local detail
